Topic Summary: 
SOLID is an acronym for 5 principles that make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. It was introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).

1. SRP – Single Responsibility Principle
 Definition:
A class should have only one reason to change.
This means a class should only do one thing, and only one actor should be able to affect its behavior.

2. OCP – Open/Closed Principle
Definition:
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

| Principle | Meaning                           | Benefit                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
|    SRP    | One class = One responsibility    | Low coupling, high cohesion  |
|    OCP    | Extend behavior without rewriting | Flexible and stable codebase |
