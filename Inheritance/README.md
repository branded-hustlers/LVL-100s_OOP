Topic : Inheritance

Topic Summary:

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a derived class (child class) 
 inherits properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from a base class (parent class).
It establishes an "is-a" relationship, enabling code reuse, polymorphism, and hierarchical organization.

Instructions for running my code::

(Include Required Libraries

Add <iostream> for input/output operations.

Add <string> to use string data type.

Use namespace std to avoid typing std:: repeatedly.

Create the Base Class (Vehicle)

Define a class named Vehicle.

Inside it:

Declare a public string variable brand with the default value "Ford".

Define a public method honk() that prints "Tuut, tuut!" followed by a newline.

Create the Derived Class (Car)

Define a class named Car that publicly inherits from Vehicle.

Inside it:

Declare a public string variable model with the default value "Mustang".

Write the main() Function

Create an object myCar of type Car.

Call the inherited method myCar.honk() (prints "Tuut, tuut!").

Print myCar.brand (inherited from Vehicle) and myCar.model (from Car), separated by a space.)

The above are the insructions for my code.
